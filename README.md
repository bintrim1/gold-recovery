# Gold Recovery
Using machine learning to predict the total amount of gold that will be recovered from raw gold ore

## Project Goal
Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for Zyfra. The company develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry.

The model should predict the amount of gold recovered from gold ore. You have the data on extraction and purification.

The model will help to optimize the production and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

You need to:

1. Prepare the data;
2. Perform data analysis;
3. Develop and train a model.
